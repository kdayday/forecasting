Generate and evaluate probabilistic solar forecasts, 
focusing on post-processing numerical weather prediction ensembles. 

Options include empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) 
    suitable for raw ensembles and persistence ensembles; Bayesian 
    model averaging (BMA) and ensemble model output statistics (EMOS)
    post-processing, and some discontinued attempts at kernel density
    estimation and spatial aggregation with copulas (not exported).
